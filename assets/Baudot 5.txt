Baudot 5

The Baudot code, invented by Ã‰mile Baudot, is a character set predating
EBCDIC and ASCII, and the root predecessor to International Telegraph
Alphabet No 2 (ITA2), the teleprinter code in use until the advent of
ASCII.

Each character in the alphabet is represented by a series of 5 bits,
sent over a communication channel such as a telegraph wire, a radio
signal or in this case a punched paper tape.

This font uses the Baudot Code and the paper tape sprocket holes to make
a decorative old school techno font..and it is free for personal use.

Enjoy
